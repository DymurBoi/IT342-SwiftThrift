### About Me
Hello! I am Virtue M. Lazaga, hailing from Cebu City. I am currently a 3rd-year student at CITU, pursuing a degree in **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)**. 

Apart from academics, I have a variety of interests and hobbies that help me unwind and keep me balanced:
- **Music:** I play in a band, which serves as a great way to relieve stress and express my creativity.
- **Gaming:** I'm an avid **Valorant** player, where I enjoy the competitive environment and bonding with friends.
- **Entertainment:** I love watching **K-dramas, anime, and movies** to relax and enjoy my downtime.
- **Dogs:** As a huge dog lover, I make sure to spend quality time with my furry companions whenever I can.
